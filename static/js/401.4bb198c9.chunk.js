Namely, whether we can explicitly determine the growth of the number of paths of any given length for a given digraph. We will focus on digraphs that contain loops, a form that we will later see arises when considering certain problems in the field of non-commutative algebra, and analyse methods for counting paths of any given length. It will be shown that the functions counting paths within digraphs of our considered form are quasipolynomial and we will analyse how the quasiperiod for functions associated to similar digraphs are related. In this report, we propose and develop a classification system for categorising the quasiperiods associated to an infinite family of graphs by considering a finite subset of its members."}]},{"institution":"Imperial College London","institutionShort":"ICL","degree":"M.Res.

This Monge-Amp`ere (MA) approach is an example of a location-based r-adaptive method, where the locations of mesh points are determined by an equation (typically a non-linear differential equation) governing how the mesh point density moves. This is as opposed to fully Lagrangian methods where individual mesh points are advected with the solutions of the underlying equations.

Temporal scaling properties of time series data can be used to detect the presence of a critical mode by estimating the decay rate, and indicators of changes in these properties may therefore be used to provide an early warning signal (EWS) for an impending tipping event. The lag-1 autocorrelation function (ACF(1)) indicator and the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) indicator have previously been used in such a way; in this paper we introduce a novel scaling indicator based on the decay rate of the power spectrum (PS). We compare the ACF(1), DFA- and PS-indicators using artificial data; data from a model which includes a bifurcation point; and sea-level pressure data along the paths of 14 tropical cyclones. By using the PS-indicator with such data, we show that the new indicator may be used to provide an EWS in a context where the ACF(1)- and DFA-indicators fail.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/121/10002"},{"title":"Generalized early warning signals in multivariate and gridded data with an application to tropical cyclones","publisher":"Chaos","date":"2019-07","abstract":"Tipping events in dynamical systems have been studied across many applications, often by measuring changes in variance or autocorrelation in a one-dimensional time series.

In this thesis, existing techniques in tipping point analysis are reviewed and a novel method, the Power Spectrum indicator, is introduced.

Many attempts have been made to find a tipping point indicator: a proxy for CSD, such that a change in the indicator acts as an early warning signal. Several generic tipping point indicators have been suggested, these include the power spectrum (PS) scaling exponent whose use as an indicator has previously been justified by its relationship to the well-established detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) exponent. In this paper we justify the use of the PS indicator analytically, by considering a mathematical formulation of the CSD phenomenon. We assess the usefulness of estimating the PS scaling exponent in a tipping point context when the PS does not exhibit power-law scaling, or changes over time. In addition we show that this method is robust against trends and oscillations in the time series, making it a good candidate for studying resilience of systems with periodic oscillations which are observed in ecology and geophysics.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac526f"}]}]')}}]);
